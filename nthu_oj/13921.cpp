/*
There’s a numberline. Initially, no point is lying on it.
Given N queries, each is one of the following two types:
1 x: Add a point x on the numberline. If x is already lying on the numberline, remove it instead.

2 x: There are a lot of segments, separated by the points on the numberline. 
You have to answer the length of the segments that x is lying on. 
If x is the endpoints of two segments, x is considered lying on the right one. 
Furthermore, if the length of the segment is infinite, output −1.

Input:
7
2 17
1 20
2 4
1 11
1 5
2 10

Output:
